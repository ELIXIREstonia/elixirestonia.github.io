# ELIXIR Estonia
<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en">Tallinn University</a></strong>, and
    <strong><a href="https://www.emu.ee/en">Estonian University of Life Sciences</a></strong>.</p>

## Latest news and announcements


### New Microchip Electrospinning Technology Paves the Way for Probiotic Wound Treatments

We are proud to share a recent publication by our team member, Marilin Moor, who contributed to a study on advanced wound care. Published in Materials Today Bio, the article titled [“Living probiotics-loaded wound matrices prepared by microchip electrospinning”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtbio.2025.102403) introduces a novel method for treating skin infections.

### Review of An Intuitive Primer of Effective Genomics Study Design

[“*An Intuitive Primer on Effective Functional Genomics Study Design*”](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Primer-Effective-Functional-Genomics/dp/B0DT9JLT6S/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5BI8RC5JVU7G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.H120vigtXK6rCO9fMttISA.selz7w3qgD8ZD-Ijrx993KubvqGOUcg6QLVgb0saoZw&dib_tag=se&keywords=An+Intuitive+Primer+on+Effective+Functional+Genomics+Study+Design&qid=1760528768&sprefix=an+intuitive+primer+on+effective+functional+genomics+study+design%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-1) by [Yoav Gilad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoav-gilad-3a5589130/) provides a clear and accessible guide to the principles of effective functional genomics study design. Instead of prescribing fixed protocols, it encourages readers to think critically about their choices. For students, teachers, and researchers entering the field, it is an insightful and practical resource that I highly recommend.
