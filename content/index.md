# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

## Hybrid seminar: Game changing development in the European patenting system: all you need to know about the Unitary Patent and the UPC

Patenting often seems out of reach for growing businesses and scientists without strong commercial support. However, the value of patenting for the development of innovation cannot be underestimated, so it is not surprising that the EPO introduced a new patenting system, including new type of patent and Patent Court that should make obtaining a patent easier and cheaper, freeing bright minds from unnecessary bureaucracy. The seminar will reveal the true impact of a simplified system on patenting strategy, as well as provide practical advice on its use.

Date: 09. May 2024, 09:00

## Webinar by SIB: Gene Expression made Useful Easily: Tools and Database of Bgee

This is a course on bioinformatics resources taught by the developers of the resources. Bgee is a curated database of gene expression in animals, including model species such as human, mouse or drosophila, and others such as livestock, primates, or fishes. Bgee integrates information from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq, microarrays, and in situ hybridization. These data are available through a web interface and an R package. Bgee also includes tools which use these data, such as TopAnat or Expression Comparison, and allows integration with users' own data through another R package. In this course, we will present the curated and pre-analysed gene expression data in Bgee.

Application Deadline: 17 May 2024
