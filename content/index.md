# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

### Course in Lausanne, Switzerland: Biodiversity bioinformatics- from large-scale phylogenomics to gene families and functions

This course is aimed at PhD students, postdoctoral and other researchers in the life sciences who are planning how to proceed with comparative genomics analyses to investigate biological or evolutionary questions of importance to their study system, particularly to leverage comparative genomics tools and resources to characterise the gene repertoires of their non-model species.

Application deadline: 16 July 2024

Date: 26 - 28 August 2024

[More Info and Registration](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20240828_COMGE)

### Webinar: ISMARA and CREMA: automatically inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression, chromatin accessibility or epigenome data

This course is aimed at PhD students, post-docs and researchers in life sciences wanting to make computational inferences about gene regulation from gene expression data, chromatin accessibility and epigenetic mark data. The course is targeted to a wide audience ranging from computational biologists and bioinformatics researchers who regularly analyse transcriptome and epigenome data, to experimental researchers interested in inferring key regulatory interactions in their own data.

Application deadline: 28 August 2024

Date:  30 August 2024

[More Info and Registration](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20240830_ISMCM)

### Course in Uppsala, Sweden: FAIR Training Material by Design

This course is composed of 7 sessions, based on the FAIR training handbook and 10 simple rules to make material FAIR publication. All sessions are structured in a way that complement each other aiming to introduce participants with a theoretical & hands-on approach of how to create FAIR material by design.

Registration: 11. April 2024 until  23- August 2024

Date: 18 - 19 September 2024

### Asynchronous e-learning course: Interoperable File Formats
In an era when data is being produced at unprecedented speed and in many different formats, data interoperability is key to sharing and archiving data.
In this 1-h course, you will learn why file format is essential to interoperability, the criteria that file formats must fulfill to be interoperable, common interoperable file formats and how to convert a file to an interoperable format.
