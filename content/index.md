# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

### Webinar:  DOME

DOME is a set of community-wide guidelines, recommendations and checklists, spanning these four areas (Data, Optimization, Model and Evaluation in Machine Learning) aiming to help establish standards of supervised machine learning validation in biology. The work was initially [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01205-4) in 2021 with more details on the [DOME-ML page](https://dome-ml.org/). This activity is part of the [Machine Learning Focus Group](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups/machine-learning). 

Date: 24 September 2024, 13:00 CEST

### Online: Ensuring More Accurate, Generalisable, and Interpretable Machine Learning Models for Bioinformatics

This course is addressed to life scientists, bioinformaticians, and computational biologists who would like to learn more about general best practices in Machine Learning and get more out of their Machine Learning models: more precise hyper-parameters, more generalizable models, and more interpretable models.

Application deadline: 29 September 2024

Date: 15 October 2024

[More Info](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20241015_INTML)

### Conference in Sweden: The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop (SBW) 2024

The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop (SBW) is an annual event that has been organized by different universities in Sweden since 2000. It is the biggest meeting of bioinformaticians and computational biologists in Sweden. Senior scientists and non-academic participants are welcome. In addition, the SBW2024 is part of the Nordic Computational Biology (Nordic CompBio) week and is open to participants from other Nordic countries (Estonia included).

Application deadline: 1st of  October 2024

Date:  4-5 November 2024

[Registration](https://www.sbw2024.org/registration/)

### Online course: Diving into deep learning - theory and applications with PyTorch

This course will not make the participant an absolute expert in the complex and dynamic world of Deep-Learning. Still, it will aim to “break the ice” through the explaination and implementation of simple yet concrete, deep-learning models using the PyTorch library. Participants will be introduced to the basic building blocks of deep-learning models and how the main parameters are tuned and monitored to ensure the training of large models. This course is aimed at PhD students, post-docs and researchers in life sciences who already know about Machine Learning and would like to discover and start practising Deep Learning with PyTorch.

Application deadline: 31 October 2024

Date: 07 - 08 November 2024

[Registration](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20241108_DEEPP)

### Virtual 2 Day Workshop SABIO-RK and FAIRDOMHub / FAIRDOM-SEEK

SABIO-RK (https://sabiork.h-its.org/) is a manually curated database for biochemical reactions and their kinetic properties. FAIRDOMHub (https://fairdomhub.org/) is a free research data management platform built upon the FAIRDOM-SEEK software (http://fairdomseek.org).  FAIRDOM-SEEK contains specific features for systems biologists for data and model management. This is an introductory course for SABIO-RK and FAIRDOMHub. You have the option to participate in either one or both of the courses.
