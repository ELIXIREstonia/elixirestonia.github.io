# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

### Webinar: ISMARA and CREMA: automatically inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression, chromatin accessibility or epigenome data

This course is aimed at PhD students, post-docs and researchers in life sciences wanting to make computational inferences about gene regulation from gene expression data, chromatin accessibility and epigenetic mark data. The course is targeted to a wide audience ranging from computational biologists and bioinformatics researchers who regularly analyse transcriptome and epigenome data, to experimental researchers interested in inferring key regulatory interactions in their own data.

Application deadline: 28 August 2024

Date:  30 August 2024

### Virtual 2 Day Workshop SABIO-RK and FAIRDOMHub / FAIRDOM-SEEK

SABIO-RK (https://sabiork.h-its.org/) is a manually curated database for biochemical reactions and their kinetic properties. FAIRDOMHub (https://fairdomhub.org/) is a free research data management platform built upon the FAIRDOM-SEEK software (http://fairdomseek.org).  FAIRDOM-SEEK contains specific features for systems biologists for data and model management. This is an introductory course for SABIO-RK and FAIRDOMHub. You have the option to participate in either one or both of the courses.

SABIO-RK: 25-NOV-2024 2:00 pm - 5:00pm (CET / UTC +1)

FAIRDOM-SEEK: 26-NOV-2024 2:00 pm - 6:00pm (CET / UTC +1)
