# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

## Course at  Bern, Switzerland: NGS - Genome Variant Analysis

The detection of genetic variation is of major interest in various disciplines spanning from ecology and evolution research to inherited disease discovery and precision oncology. Next generation sequencing (NGS) methods are very powerful for the detection of genomic variants. Thanks to its throughput and cost-efficiency it enables the detection of a large number of variants in a large number of samples. In this two-day course we will cover the steps from read alignment to variant calling and annotation. We will mainly focus on the detection of germline mutations by following the GATK best practices. 

Application deadline: 15 February 2024

## Course at EMBL-EBI: Summer school in bioinformatics

European Bioinformatics Institute United Kingdom in association with Elixir Estonia are organising summer school in bioinformatics. This course provides an introduction to the use of bioinformatics in biological research, giving you guidance for using bioinformatics in your work whilst also providing hands-on training in tools and resources appropriate to your research.

Applicants are expected to be at an early stage of using bioinformatics in their research with the need to develop their knowledge and skills further. No previous knowledge of programming is required for this course.

Applications close: 25 February 2024

## Online course: Enrichment Analysis

Experiments designed to quantify gene expression often yield hundreds of genes that show statistically significant differences between groups of interest. Once differentially expressed genes are identified, enrichment analysis (EA) methods can be used to explore the biological functions associated with these genes. EA methods allow us to identify groups of genes (e.g. particular pathways) that are over-represented, thereby offering insights into biological mechanisms. One of the EA methods frequently used for high-throughput gene expression data analysis is Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). This course will cover GSEA and alternative enrichment methods. Because the implementation of GSEA is directly linked to databases that annotate the function of genes in a cell, the course will also give an overview of functional annotation databases such as Gene Ontology.

Application deadline: 26 February 2024

## Course at  Breda, The Netherlands: RNA-seq data analysis

The 9th edition of the RNA-seq Data Analysis course will be held on 8-12 April – 2024 in Breda, The Netherlands. This course covers the basic concepts and methods required for RNA-seq analysis. Particular attention is given to the data analysis pipelines for differential transcript expression and variant calling. The course consists of a mixture of lectures and Galaxy, Linux and R practicals. Also the potential of long-read based RNA-seq and AI based analysis enrichments will be explored.
