# ELIXIR Estonia
<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en">Tallinn University</a></strong>, and
    <strong><a href="https://www.emu.ee/en">Estonian University of Life Sciences</a></strong>.</p>

## Latest news and announcements


### FiBar: A New Tool for Fiber Diameter Analysis in Drug Delivery Research

This summer, Marilin Moor, Product Manager of ELIXIR Estonia and now a PhD student at the University of Tartu, published a new [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2025.107179) presenting [FiBar](https://fibar.elixir.ut.ee/), a tool for analysing fiber diameters in complex drug delivery systems. The research was carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Pharmacy (Laura Männaste, Marta Putrinš and Professor Karin Kogermann) and Dmytro Fishman, Associate Professor in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu.

[More info](https://elixir.ut.ee/news/2025/09/11/FiBar_aricle/) 


### RDMkit: Guiding Life Scientists in Research Data Management

ELIXIR Estonia is proud to showcase the [Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), a community-led knowledge resource for life sciences that helps researchers and data stewards navigate the complexities of managing research data. Developed through the [ELIXIR CONVERGE project](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge ) and supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme, the RDMkit provides guidance on Research Data management that aligns with FAIR principles, ensuring data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

### Learning Data Management the Scary Way

What happens when you forget to back up your research data? Or when a tiny mistake in Excel changes your results completely? This autumn, [ELIXIR Estonia](https://elixir.ut.ee/) is taking a playful, but serious look at what can go wrong in data management.
