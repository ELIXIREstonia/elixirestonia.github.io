# ELIXIR Estonia
<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en">Tallinn University</a></strong>, and
    <strong><a href="https://www.emu.ee/en">Estonian University of Life Sciences</a></strong>.</p>

### Not professorware - g:Profiler turns 18 and helps thousands of researchers yearly!

g:Profiler, a popular gene list analysis tool, celebrates 18 years since its first publication in [Nucleic Acids Research](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm226). What began as a student project has become a globally cited resource, with its [2019 update article](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz369) now surpassing 5,000 citations â€” a testament to its lasting impact in life sciences.

### Switzerland: Introduction to Metagenomics Data Analysis of Microbial Communities

This course will cover the metagenomics data analysis workflow from data generation to downstream analysis. Participants will explore the tools to manage, share, analyze and interpret metagenomics data. The content will include issues of data quality control and how to process the data until publication.Both targeted marker-gene (e.g., 16S) and whole-genome shotgun (WGS) approaches will be covered. Discussions will also explore considerations when selecting the sequencing options (long or short reads), exploring targeted data to OTUs or ASVs, assembling and binning metagenomics data, the analyses that can be carried out, and what downstream analyses options and tools are available.

Application deadline: 30 April 2025

Date: 07 - 09 May 2025
