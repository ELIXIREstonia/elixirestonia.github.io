# ELIXIR Estonia
<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en">Tallinn University</a></strong>, and
    <strong><a href="https://www.emu.ee/en">Estonian University of Life Sciences</a></strong>.</p>

### Online: Statistics and Machine Learning for Life Sciences

This course was designed to guide participants in the exploration of the concepts of statistical modelling, and at the same time relate and contrast them with machine learning approaches when it comes to both classification and regression. A particular focus will be given on the evaluation of the relevance of the produced models, and their interpretation in order to provide new biological knowledge.

Application deadline: 20 March 2025

Time: 03 - 04 April 2025

### Course in Sweden: Advanced Data Visualization

This course is designed to help researchers in visualizing their data through various techniques using R and Quarto. Participants will learn how to create publication-ready visualisations with R. Additionally, the course also includes introductions to Quarto and dynamic plotting using tools like plotly, OJS, etc. The last day of the course includes interactive plotting that can be hosted on a web server, enabling researchers to share and explore visualizations of their data.

Application deadline: 31 March 2025

Time: 13 May- 15 May 2025

### Czechia: 6th Hands-on Computational Enzyme Design Course

Do you need to engineer your protein of interest? Do you wish to employ user-friendly one-stop-shop software tools for the design of mutations and libraries, but do not want to spend time on tedious installations or use the Unix command-line? This interactive course will provide essential theory on different areas of enzyme engineering and hands-on experience with several software tools suitable for mining new enzymes, and engineering the activity, specificity, enantioselectivity, stability, and solubility of enzymes. To remain at the cutting edge of scientific advancements, we will also explore the applications of machine learning techniques and quantum computing in enzyme design.

Application deadline early bird: 31.3.2025

Application deadline: 30.4.2025

Date: 2 - 5 JUNE, 2025
