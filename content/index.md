# ELIXIR Estonia
<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en">Tallinn University</a></strong>, and

## Latest news and announcements

### ELIXIR Estonia’s January to June 2025 Highlights

The first half of 2025 has shown how ELIXIR Estonia combines international collaboration, national community-building, and innovative training to support researchers. With initiatives in citizen science, data management network, and skill development, the team is contributing to the foundation for a strong, sustainable research data ecosystem in Estonia.

[More info](news/posts/2025/Newsletter_2025-01.md)


### ELIXIR’s student topics for ATI Day 24.09.2025

ELIXIR Estonia is building and maintaining web tools and other resources for life science research. We aim to build things that last and are useful over a longer period. 
We offer 4 topics: 

* Topic 1: Modernising KEGGanim web application
* Topic 2: Contrastive Learning for Microscopy Image Understanding 
* Topic 3: Vision learning to understand how good a basketball player X is in situation Y? 
* Topic 4: Evaluating the Impact of Data Update Frequency on Functional Annotations Across 1000 Species Using g:Profiler data archives

### FiBar: A New Tool for Fiber Diameter Analysis in Drug Delivery Research

This summer, Marilin Moor, Product Manager of ELIXIR Estonia and now a PhD student at the University of Tartu, published a new [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2025.107179) presenting [FiBar](https://fibar.elixir.ut.ee/), a tool for analysing fiber diameters in complex drug delivery systems. The research was carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Pharmacy (Laura Männaste, Marta Putrinš and Professor Karin Kogermann) and Dmytro Fishman, Associate Professor in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu.

### RDMkit: Guiding Life Scientists in Research Data Management

ELIXIR Estonia is proud to showcase the [Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit)](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/), a community-led knowledge resource for life sciences that helps researchers and data stewards navigate the complexities of managing research data. Developed through the [ELIXIR CONVERGE project](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge ) and supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme, the RDMkit provides guidance on Research Data management that aligns with FAIR principles, ensuring data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

### Learning Data Management the Scary Way

What happens when you forget to back up your research data? Or when a tiny mistake in Excel changes your results completely? This autumn, [ELIXIR Estonia](https://elixir.ut.ee/) is taking a playful, but serious look at what can go wrong in data management.

 title="Webinar: Reusing Research Data: Opportunities, Challenges, and the FAIR Way Forward"
 description="Making sense of someone else’s data isn’t always easy. What are the challenges of interpreting and integrating datasets generated by others? Why is it crucial that the FAIR principles – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Resuable, are followed when data are shared?
In this session, we’ll hear from two experienced practitioners of secondary data analysis. Join us to learn how FAIR data can lead to new discoveries — and what it takes to make that happen"

 title="Open Data in the Humanities: Balancing Legal Constraints, FAIR Principles and AI"
 description="In our online presentation, we share practical experiences from our collaboration with humanities projects. Our focus is on facilitating the sharing and reuse of data by providing clear legal information for the users of our platform. But the reality is often complex: many cultural institutions do not make their archives publicly available or do not allow the data to be reused in its entirety. How could a project reuse material that they are not allowed to share publicly?In addition, new technologies such as AI raise questions – and sometimes fears. What influence can it have on the open access mentality?"

 title="Hybrid: Open Science in the Light of Geopolitical Polarization"
 description="The current geopolitical landscape is characterized by rising political and trade tensions as well as heightened economic interest in scientific innovation. This polarization has significant implications for the global scientific community, particularly in the pursuit of Open Science. Could the naivety of science be exploited? Where is the line between scientific idealism and naivety? As major global powers engage in systemic rivalries, the conduct of science is increasingly influenced by national security concerns, export controls, and sanctions that can restrict the free flow of ideas, data, and researchers across borders. Meanwhile, global challenges such as pandemics, climate change, and technology-based development require international scientific collaboration and universal knowledge development. The normative nature of the scientific ethos is increasingly in tension with political forces that demand that science be both vigilant and competitive.
How can Open Science – with its emphasis on transparency, collaboration, efficiency and validity of scientific results – be sustained in the light of these competing interests?"

 title="Online: Introduction to Research Software Management"
 description="Research Software (e.g. computer code, statistical packages, scientific apps) plays a crucial role in research projects, contributing to the reproducibility and reliability of results. In this introductory workshop, learn the basic concepts of managing research software, including best practices, version control, and documentation with Github/Gitlab. Through practical examples, explore key concepts for software management plans and how they are applied in practice."
