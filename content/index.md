# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

## Webinar by EMBL-EBI: Bioinformatic approaches to understand the role of the human microbiome in health and disease

This webinar will provide an overview of current metagenomic approaches to study the human microbiome and introduce several statistical methods that can be used to link its composition and function to different human phenotypes and populations.
This webinar is suitable for those interested in studying the microbiomes of any environment or host. Although the presentation will be focused on the human microbiome, the methods and techniques discussed will also be applicable to other microbial ecosystems. No prior knowledge of bioinformatics is required, but undergraduate level knowledge of biology would be useful.

Date & Time: Mar 6, 2024 05:30 PM

## Course at  Bern, Switzerland: Single-Cell Transcriptomics with R

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) allows researchers to study gene expression at the single cell level. For example, scRNAseq can help to identify expression patterns that differ between conditions within a cell-type. To generate and analyze scRNAseq data, several methods are available, all with their strengths and weaknesses depending on the researchers’ needs. This 3-day course will cover the main technologies as well as the main aspects to consider while designing a scRNAseq experiment. In addition, it will cover the theoretical background of analysis methods with hands-on practical data analysis sessions applied to droplet-based methods.

Application deadline: 06 March 2024
