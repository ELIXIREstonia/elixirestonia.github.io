# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

### Course in EBI, UK: Gene-environment interactions in human health and disease

This introductory course is  aimed at MRes/PhD students, researchers, clinicians, and other professionals working in the fields of genomics, exposomics, epidemiology, or toxicology with an interest in understanding how interactions between genes and the environment underlie human phenotypes. The course will cover the underlying concepts, computational resources, and computational modelling methods available to investigate interactions between genes and the environment (including social, biological, and physical exposures). 

Registration deadline: 15 December 2024

Date: 17 - 21 March 2025
