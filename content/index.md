# ELIXIR Estonia

**The purpose** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to construct and
operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.

**The goal** of [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) is to coordinate these
resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
practices.

**Estonia** joined [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org) as a full member in
December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
least, training researchers across borders.

Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by **[University of Tartu](https://www.ut.ee/en)**.
Other partners are
**[Tallinn University of Technology](https://taltech.ee/en)**,
**[National Institute for Physics and Biophysics](https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en)**,
**[Tallinn University](https://www.tlu.ee/en)**, and
**[Estonian University of Life Sciences](https://www.emu.ee/en)**.

### BY-COVID project wrap-up and success stories

The BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) project aimed to provide extensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases, emphasizing the mobilization of raw viral sequences to monitor the spread of variants. To ensure global collaboration, it enabled federated data analysis, managed metadata, and facilitated long-term cataloguing. Success stories can be read [here](https://by-covid.org/pdf/update-elixir-by-covid-brochure-1-7-DIGITAL.pdf), on page 16 is project lead by University of Tartu: [Infectious Diseases Toolkit](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/).

### Online course: Diving into deep learning - theory and applications with PyTorch

This course will not make the participant an absolute expert in the complex and dynamic world of Deep-Learning. Still, it will aim to “break the ice” through the explaination and implementation of simple yet concrete, deep-learning models using the PyTorch library. Participants will be introduced to the basic building blocks of deep-learning models and how the main parameters are tuned and monitored to ensure the training of large models. This course is aimed at PhD students, post-docs and researchers in life sciences who already know about Machine Learning and would like to discover and start practising Deep Learning with PyTorch.

Application deadline: 31 October 2024

Date: 07 - 08 November 2024
