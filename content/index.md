# ELIXIR Estonia
<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en">Tallinn University</a></strong>, and

### Review of An Intuitive Primer of Effective Genomics Study Design

[“*An Intuitive Primer on Effective Functional Genomics Study Design*”](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Primer-Effective-Functional-Genomics/dp/B0DT9JLT6S/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5BI8RC5JVU7G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.H120vigtXK6rCO9fMttISA.selz7w3qgD8ZD-Ijrx993KubvqGOUcg6QLVgb0saoZw&dib_tag=se&keywords=An+Intuitive+Primer+on+Effective+Functional+Genomics+Study+Design&qid=1760528768&sprefix=an+intuitive+primer+on+effective+functional+genomics+study+design%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-1) by [Yoav Gilad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoav-gilad-3a5589130/) provides a clear and accessible guide to the principles of effective functional genomics study design. Instead of prescribing fixed protocols, it encourages readers to think critically about their choices. For students, teachers, and researchers entering the field, it is an insightful and practical resource that I highly recommend.

 title="Hybrid: Open Science in the Light of Geopolitical Polarization"
 description="The current geopolitical landscape is characterized by rising political and trade tensions as well as heightened economic interest in scientific innovation. This polarization has significant implications for the global scientific community, particularly in the pursuit of Open Science. Could the naivety of science be exploited? Where is the line between scientific idealism and naivety? As major global powers engage in systemic rivalries, the conduct of science is increasingly influenced by national security concerns, export controls, and sanctions that can restrict the free flow of ideas, data, and researchers across borders. Meanwhile, global challenges such as pandemics, climate change, and technology-based development require international scientific collaboration and universal knowledge development. The normative nature of the scientific ethos is increasingly in tension with political forces that demand that science be both vigilant and competitive.
How can Open Science – with its emphasis on transparency, collaboration, efficiency and validity of scientific results – be sustained in the light of these competing interests?"

  title="Online: Enrichment Analysis"
  description="Experiments designed to quantify gene expression often yield hundreds of genes with statistically significant differences between groups. After identifying these genes, enrichment analysis (EA) methods help explore the biological functions associated with them. This course covers Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and alternative methods, with an overview of annotation databases such as Gene Ontology."
