<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,

### Material: Mastering data management: Go FAIR, Go Open, Go Smart â€” EMO BON and TREC showcases

Making data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) and open benefits both for the data provider and future users.  In this webinar, we will discuss how making data FAIR and open has allowed us to develop smart and efficient data management workflows in the context of the EMBRC EMO BON (European Marine Omics Biodiversity Observation Network) project. By focusing on the interoperability and reusability of our (meta)data, codes, and analysis results, we can use the web itself to make our data findable and accessible. We will then present examples of metadata curation from EMBLâ€™s Planetary biology flagship expedition TREC (Traversing European Coastlines), an expedition to study coastal ecosystems and their response to the environment, from molecules to communities. We will see how one can go FAIR, Open and Smart by registering sample metadata at EMBL-EBIâ€™s BioSamples service using checklists, controlled vocabularies and ontologies.
