# ELIXIR Estonia
<div class="elixir-main-container">
  <div class="elixir-main-text">
    <p><strong>The purpose</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to construct and
    operate a sustainable infrastructure for biological information in Europe to
    support life science research and its translation to medicine and the
    environment, the bio-industries and society. These resources include databases,
    software tools, training materials, cloud storage and supercomputers.</p>
    <p><strong>The goal</strong> of <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> is to coordinate these
    resources so that they form a single high quality infrastructure. This
    coordinated infrastructure makes it easier for researchers to find and share
    data, analyse their experiments, exchange knowledge, and agree on best
    practices.</p>
    <p><strong>Estonia</strong> joined <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org">ELIXIR</a> as a full member in
    December 2013. The Estonian node focuses on developing and maintaining software
    tools and databases, linking of bioinformatics and biobanking, and last but not
    least, training researchers across borders.</p>
    <p>Estonian ELIXIR Node is led by <strong><a href="https://www.ut.ee/en">University of Tartu</a></strong>.
    Other partners are
    <strong><a href="https://taltech.ee/en">Tallinn University of Technology</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://kbfi.ee/?lang=en">National Institute for Physics and Biophysics</a></strong>,
    <strong><a href="https://www.tlu.ee/en">Tallinn University</a></strong>, and

### Review of An Intuitive Primer of Effective Genomics Study Design

[“*An Intuitive Primer on Effective Functional Genomics Study Design*”](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Primer-Effective-Functional-Genomics/dp/B0DT9JLT6S/ref=sr_1_1?crid=5BI8RC5JVU7G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.H120vigtXK6rCO9fMttISA.selz7w3qgD8ZD-Ijrx993KubvqGOUcg6QLVgb0saoZw&dib_tag=se&keywords=An+Intuitive+Primer+on+Effective+Functional+Genomics+Study+Design&qid=1760528768&sprefix=an+intuitive+primer+on+effective+functional+genomics+study+design%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-1) by [Yoav Gilad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoav-gilad-3a5589130/) provides a clear and accessible guide to the principles of effective functional genomics study design. Instead of prescribing fixed protocols, it encourages readers to think critically about their choices. For students, teachers, and researchers entering the field, it is an insightful and practical resource that I highly recommend.

### FiBar: A New Tool for Fiber Diameter Analysis in Drug Delivery Research

This summer, Marilin Moor, Product Manager of ELIXIR Estonia and now a PhD student at the University of Tartu, published a new [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2025.107179) presenting [FiBar](https://fibar.elixir.ut.ee/), a tool for analysing fiber diameters in complex drug delivery systems. The research was carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Pharmacy (Laura Männaste, Marta Putrinš and Professor Karin Kogermann) and Dmytro Fishman, Associate Professor in Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu.

  title="Online: R for geospatial predictive mapping"
  description="This talk introduces practical workflows for building reliable spatial predictions in R, illustrated with a real-world case study on predicting plant species richness across South America. We’ll start with classic interpolation methods like IDW and kriging, then move to machine learning approaches using Random Forests. Common pitfalls like unrealistic predictions and spatial bias will be discussed, along with practical solutions such as the Area of Applicability (AoA) and adaptive cross-validation methods. All examples include reproducible R code, making it easy to adapt the workflows to different spatial prediction tasks."

   description="You are invited to join this webinar led by Pro. Edward M. Marcotte (University of Texas at Austin), where he will describe how interest in deeply conserved human genes and pathways led to systematic determination of core multi-protein assemblies, shared widely across eukaryotes—many dating back to the last common ancestor. Insights from mass spectrometry experiments will reveal their composition, interactions, and inform functions and 3D molecular assemblies. Moderation by Prof. Arne Elofsson and support by Dr Gonzalo Parra."
