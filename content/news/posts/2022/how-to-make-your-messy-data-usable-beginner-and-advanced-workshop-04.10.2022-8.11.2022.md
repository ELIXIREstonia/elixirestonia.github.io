# How to Make Your Messy Data Usable? - Beginner and Advanced workshop - 04.10.2022/8.11.2022

<p>On the 4th of October 2022, ELIXIR-Estonia will be holding a data management online course: <strong>How to Make Your Messy Data Usable? - PART 1</strong>. The course will be held in English. This course will be in two parts: a 1.5-hour online lecture on how to make a spreadsheet usable for other people held on the 4th of October at 10:00 in Zoom. The practical workshop on cleaning your messy data with OpenRefine software will be a video lecture you can follow in your own time. Additionally, we will hold 2 Q&amp;A sessions in Zoom, where you can talk about any problems you encountered with the OpenRefine software.</p>

<p>This course will cover how to name your files and variables, version control, compile a data dictionary, and what to do with empty cells. In the second part of this lecture, OpenRefine software is introduced. With this, you can easily clean up the messy data. For the more practical aspect of using the OpenRefine software, we will share a video that will teach the basics. You can watch it anytime and do the lessons yourself. On two days (7.10 and 10.10), there will be a 1h slot (10:00-11:00) on Zoom, when you can come and ask any question you have regarding tables and OpenRefine software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the 8th of November 2022, ELIXIR-Estonia will be holding a data management online course: <strong>How to Make Your Messy Data Usable? - PART 2</strong>. The course will be held in English. This course will be in two parts: a 1-hour online lecture on what you can do in OpenRefine, including transformations, expressions, and extensions for the software, held on the 8th of November at 10:00 in Zoom. The practical workshop on how to transform your previously cleaned data with OpenRefine software will be a video lecture that you can follow in your own time. Additionally, we will hold 2 Q&amp;A sessions in Zoom, where you can talk about any problems you encountered with the OpenRefine software.</p>

<p>This is a follow-up workshop for “How to make your messy data usable - PART 1”, where we talked about spreadsheets but also introduced the OpenRefine software. This course will explore the depths of OpenRefine software and see what else it can offer. This will include cleaning the data in bigger batches and unifying the data in one sweep. These include transformations and expressions. Additionally, we will introduce the possibility of downloading additional data from other databases and different extensions OpenRefine software has.&nbsp;</p>
