# "Bring Your Own Data Management Plan” workshop - Invitations only

<p>According to the Estonian Research Council funding agreement, all the projects that have started from 2022 have to submit a data management plan (DMP) within the first 6 months. Since this will be a new thing for a lot of researchers, University of Tartu, University of Tartu Library,&nbsp; ELIXIR Estonia and The Estonian Research Council will be doing a data management writing course for this purpose. This workshop will be with invitations only. “Bring Your Own Data Management Plan” workshop (in English) will consist of two sessions: one online introduction and one face-to-face writing session. The writing sessions will be held both in Tartu and in Tallinn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The online session will be held 20th of May at 11:00 - 14:30, with one 15 min break in between the sessions. Within this time, Tiiu Tarkpea will give an overview of Open Science in Estonia. We have also invited people from the Estonian Research Council, so they can answer your questions in person. Additionally, there are also two DMP writing&nbsp;tool introductions: DMPonline by Tiiu Tarkpea (University of Tartu Library) and Data Stewardship Wizard by Federico Bianchini (ELIXIR Norway).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that you can pick from two face-to-face sessions, in case you need any help with the writing of the DMP part (participation not mandatory). The 26th of May (14:00-17:00) session will be held in Tartu and the 6th of June (14:00-17:00) session will be held at Tallinn (the precise location will be sent with an email). In this, we will be talking about the theory of different aspects of the DMP, giving more practical advice&nbsp; and there will be two 1h writing sessions, where you can write most of your DMP. Also, if you have any questions, the organizers (Tiiu Tarkpea and Heleri Inno) will help as best as they can.&nbsp;</p>
