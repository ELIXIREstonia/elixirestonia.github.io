# Virtual meeting: Handling Pandemic Omics Data in the Nordics

<p>A two-days online meeting that will bring perspectives on Nordic infrastructures and approaches used to handle SARS-Cov-2 sequencing data. The event will take place on 18-19 May 2022 from 09:00-13:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time). The meeting is organised by members of ELIXIR Norway, ELIXIR Estonia, and SciLifeLab Data Centre.</p>

<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has understandably received considerable attention worldwide over the last few years. As it spread across the globe, the pandemic posed significant challenges for society, governmental bodies, healthcare systems, and research communities. Unprecedented efforts were necessary to generate, handle, and report the sheer amount of complex data required to be able to understand how SARS-CoV-2 was spreading, and develop efficient policies to fight the pandemic. I</p>

<p>n this online event, we will focus on how the Nordic region handled omics data. We will focus in particular on how sequencing efforts were coordinated, how data was managed and shared, and how data was used and communicated to different groups. We will also discuss the importance of the FAIR principles in pandemic data management, and which tools and pipelines facilitated efforts. We also hope to identify key resources that have wider applicability and can be reused further.</p>
