# Licensing Research Outputs lecture - 27.09.2022

<p>On the 27th of September 2022, ELIXIR-Estonia will hold a new data management lecture: <strong>Licensing Research Outputs</strong>. The course will be held in English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While doing scientific research, you handle different kinds of research outputs, whether they are produced by you or by somebody else. So, how can you ensure that other people will give you credit when using your produced materials? And how will you know how exactly you can use the resources produced by others? This is a topic that copyright laws handle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This lecture will cover what copyright laws do, who has the rights to the materials, and how you can use them. Most of this information is protected with licenses, whether they are meant for figures, data, or software. This lecture will discuss what licenses to use for different materials and what each license covers (this means how people can use the materials). We will also show how exactly you can apply a license to your research outputs.&nbsp;</p>
