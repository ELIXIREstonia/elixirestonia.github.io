# New Microchip Electrospinning Technology Paves the Way for Probiotic Wound Treatments

We are proud to share a recent publication by our team member, Marilin Moor, who contributed to a study on advanced wound care. Published in Materials Today Bio, the article titled [“Living probiotics-loaded wound matrices prepared by microchip electrospinning”](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtbio.2025.102403) introduces a novel method for treating skin infections.

The study introduces a microchip electrospinning technology for producing fibrous wound matrices loaded with living probiotics. Experimental results confirmed the presence and viability of the probiotics within the electrospun fibers. These findings represent a step toward developing alternative treatments for wound-related infections such as atopic dermatitis, acne, and chronic wounds.

The research highlights that microchip electrospinning technology shows great potential to streamline the fabrication of wound matrices. For the ELIXIR community, this proposed method offers a valuable new approach to biomedical engineering, with promising applications in the targeted treatment of wound-related infections.

This work was a collaborative effort involving researchers from the [University of Tartu’s](https://ut.ee/et) [Institute of Pharmacy](https://farmaatsia.ut.ee/en), [Institute of Technology](https://tuit.ut.ee/en), and [Institute of Computer Science](https://cs.ut.ee/en), as well as [the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research at the Polish Academy of Sciences](https://www.ippt.pan.pl/en/).
