 Join our workshop for practical guidance on Data Management Plans (DMPs). We'll discuss relevant resources, the data life cycle, READMEs, GDPR considerations, and FAIR data sharing. The session incorporates 3-4 dedicated 30-minute writing blocks for you to actively draft your DMP. Our data steward will be present throughout to offer support and answer your questions.
