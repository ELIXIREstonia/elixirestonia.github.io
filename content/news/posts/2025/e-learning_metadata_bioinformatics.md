# E-Learning: Metadata in Bioinformatics

Have you heard the word metadata but have no idea what it refers to, what type of content is found in metadata, how it is being used and why to use it? This asynchronous e-learning course (1h)  can be completed online, at the desired pace and in the absence of an instructor.

## Overview

Every day, experimental scientists create and store high-throughput data. This data is then analysed by bioinformaticians who store the results. This mass of data has been referred to as 'data tsunami,' a term that accurately conveys the scale, velocity, and disruptive potential of the data collection and storage. How does metadata play a role in the efficient management of this data?

Metadata has been described as "data about data", but what exactly is meant by this? What type of information about the data does metadata contain? Why provide metadata at all?

In this 1-h course, you will learn what metadata is, some elements of metadata, common uses of metadata in bioinformatics, in order to understand why metadata are essential.

## Audience

This e-learning course is for students, postdocs, researchers, and data managers from any scientific environment (academia, facilities, companies, etc.) interested in metadata.

## Learning outcomes

* explain what metadata is
* identify metadata content standards
* recall common uses of metadata in bioinformatics
* explore uses of metadata
* Describe the use of metadata in bioinformatics
* Understand why metadata are essential
