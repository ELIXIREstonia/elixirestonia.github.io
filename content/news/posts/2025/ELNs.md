## Description

Have you ever wondered what an Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) is and why it's so crucial? Curious about how it can enhance the management of your microbial research data? If so, NFDI4Microbiota and de.NBI have crafted the perfect interactive training session for you, combining informative presentations with hands-on exercises!

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to ELNs, emphasizing their advantages over traditional paper notebooks. Participants will gain hands-on experience based on a demo in setting up and using an ELN, including initial team configuration, navigation, and the creation and organization of entries. The curriculum encompasses best practices for data entry, efficient management and cross-referencing  organization of research data., and strategies to ensure data integrity and reproducibility. Also the management of Lab-Ressources and the booking system will be covered.

The training will highlight the importance of collaboration and sharing within an ELN environment, instructing participants on how to set permissions and, share data seamlessly, and manage version control. Essential compliance and security topics will also be covered to ensure that data handling adheres to institutional and funder policies., with thorough considerations for data security, privacy, backup, and recovery solutions.

This course is ideal for anyone working with microbial research data who seeks to improve their data management and collaboration skills through the use of ELNs.
