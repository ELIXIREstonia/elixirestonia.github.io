# Course in France: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Life Sciences- from foundations to applications

This 4 day school will guide across the various steps in Machine Learning, from the foundational concepts, through the deep learning and generative AI techniques, closely complemented by insights into the existing reporting (DOME Recommendations) and regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act).

Application deadline: 24.01.2025

Date: May 19th 2025 - May 23rd 2025

## Description

Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated our lives, transforming how we live and work. Over the past few years, a rapid and disruptive acceleration of progress in AI has occurred, driven by significant advances in widespread data availability, computing power and machine learning. Remarkable strides were made in particular in the development of foundation models - AI models trained on extensive volumes of unlabelled data. Moreover, given the large amounts of omics data that are being generated and made accessible to researchers due to the drop in the cost of high-throughput technologies, analysing these complex high-volume data is not trivial, and the use of classical statistics can not explore their full potential. As such, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been recognized as key opportunity areas for ELIXIR, as evidenced by a number of ongoing activities and efforts throughout the community.


However, beyond the technological advances, it is equally important that the individual researchers acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to fully take advantage of Machine Learning. Being aware of the challenges, opportunities and constraints that ML applications entail, is a critical aspect in ensuring high quality research in life sciences


Recognizing this need, this week-long training will bring together experts from four ELIXIR Nodes and deliver a hands-on, high-intensity course, available for members from all ELIXIR Nodes.

This 4-day school will involve around ten trainers/helpers from across 4 different ELIXIR nodes. This course will take place in the Centre de Vacances et Colloques Paul Langevin (CNRS), in the village of Aussois (Savoie, France). The event will start on Monday May 19th 2025 after lunch and end on Friday May 23rd 2025 around lunch time.

The registration fees (including accommodation in single rooms and meals) are 650 EUR for academics and 1000 EUR for for-profit companies.

## Audience

This course is addressed to bioinformaticians, biostatisticians, bioanalysts, life scientists and biomedical researchers with good python programming skills and general knowledge of Machine Learning approches.

## Requirements

The level of this course is intermediate, with the following requirements:

* experience with data analysis
