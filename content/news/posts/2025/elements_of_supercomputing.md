## Overview

Modern technological, scientific and industrial breakthroughs require more and more sophisticated and advanced tools in solving the greatest challenges of the world and human kind. We need supercomputers.

Supercomputers are immensely powerful computers capable of advanced modeling and computing that has only been possible for some years. But how powerful is a supercomputer? How are they built and why do we need them? What are their main advantages and possibilities?

In this free online course we’ll examine these questions and many more. You will learn the fundamentals of supercomputers and high performance computing, the essential vocabulary needed to understand what supercomputers and high performance computing really are all about, and what is needed to understand how they are being operated. By the end of the course, you will have the theoretical knowledge needed to explain the basic principles of a supercomputer and high performance computing. We’ll also take a look at some real-life examples and practical use cases of these amazing machines.
