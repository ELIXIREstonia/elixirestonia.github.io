Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is an interpreted language, which makes it suitable for rapid development and prototyping of programming segments or complete small programs.

Python’s main advantages:

* Open source software, supported by Python Software Foundation
* Available on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* It is a good language for new programmers to learn due to its straightforward, object-oriented style.
* It is well-structured, which aids readability.
* It is extensible (i.e. modifiable) and is supported by a large community that provides a comprehensive range of 3rd party packages.
