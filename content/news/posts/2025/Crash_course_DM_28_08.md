Data management is an essential part of scientific research and is crucial for maximising the value of data. Crash Course in Data Management is an introductory course that equips researchers with the necessary skills for effective organisation and management of research data. Participants will gain knowledge of best practices in file naming, file organisation, data backup, data preservation and sharing. We will go through exercises and assignments to reinforce new knowledge.
