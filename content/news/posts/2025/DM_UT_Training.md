Our Data Manager, Heleri, and Training Coordinator, Diana, took part in the event and contributed to the training alongside Liisi Lembinen and Tiiu Tarkpea from the University of Tartu Library. Together, they shared practical insights and experiences with the network members.

We thank Liisi Lembinen for organising this important training and inviting ELIXIR Estonia to participate. Collaborations like this are essential for strengthening Estoniaâ€™s research data management and open science practices.

We look forward to continued collaboration and the growing impact of the University of Tartu Data Management and Open Science competence network.
