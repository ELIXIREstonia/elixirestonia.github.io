This is a 2-day workshop for biologists needing to perform statistical analyses using R. 

<!-- more -->

This course is designed to provide researchers in biomedical sciences with experience in the application of basic statistical analysis techniques to a variety of biological problems.
The course will combine lectures on statistics and practical exercises, during which the participants will learn how to work with the widely used "R" language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

Topics covered during the course include: reminders about numerical and graphical summaries, and hypothesis testing; multiple testing, linear models, correlation and regression, and other topics. Participants will also have the opportunity to ask questions about the analysis of their own data.

The course extensively covers materials from https://sib-swiss.github.io/Introduction-to-statistics-with-R/

## Requirements 

Basics of RStudio IDE, basics of R: 

* knows how to install packages, 
* knows basic data operations - loading in data, fetching data from dataframe, table transformations/pipes, 
* basic concepts of plotting - easy plotting in ggplot2 or some other plotting library

Test your knowledge here: https://www.evamariakiss.de/tutorial/rquiz/quiz_fundamentals.php

Please note, if you get >= 50%, you are eligible for this course. Else, try to find a Basics in R course before attending this one - we provide courses in this too! Materials for that course are available here: https://github.com/ELIXIREstonia/2025-02-18-R-basic-stat 

Technical prerequisites: 

To do the exercises, you are required to have 

* your own computer with at least 4 Gb of RAM and with an internet connection,
* as well as the latest the version of [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (version 4.4.2, release date 2024-10-31)
* the free version of [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) installed.
