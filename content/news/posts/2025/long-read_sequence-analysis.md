## Description

For the last few years, research in DNA and RNA has been dominated by short-read sequencing. Although this has revolutionized the way we answer biological questions, it has its limitations. One important limitation is read length. The invention of high-throughput long-read sequencing has enabled us to solve questions on genome assembly, haplotyping, structural variation and alternative splicing. In this course, the participant will get acquainted with the major long-read sequencing technologies (PacBio SMRT and Oxford Nanopore Technology), and get experience with hands-on work involving long-read data. The training materials for this course are in its dedicated GitHub page. The course includes a guest lecture from Dr. Alban Ramette and Dr. Pamela Nicholson.
