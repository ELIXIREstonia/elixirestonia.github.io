# Virtual course by EMBL-EBI: Microscopy data analysis: machine learning and the BioImage Archive

This virtual course will show how public bioimaging data resources, centred around the BioImage Archive, enable and enhance machine learning based image analysis. The content will explore a variety of data types including electron and light microscopy and miscellaneous or multi-modal imaging data at the cell and tissue scale. Participants will cover contemporary biological image analysis with an emphasis on machine learning methods, as well as how to access and use images from databases. 

Applications close: 19 January 2025

Date: 31 March - 04 April 2025

## Description

This course will be a virtual event delivered via a mixture of live-streamed sessions, pre-recorded lectures, and tutorials with live support. We will be using Zoom to run the live sessions (all fully password protected with automated English closed captioning and transcription) with support and both scientific and social networking opportunities provided by Slack and other methods, taking different time zones into account.

In order to make the most out of the course, you should make sure to have a stable internet connection throughout the week and are available between 08:00 – 18:00 BST each day. In the week before the course there will be a brief induction session. Computational practicals will run on EMBL-EBI's virtual training infrastructure, meaning participants will not require access to a powerful computer or install complex software on their own machines.

Selected participants may be sent materials prior to the course. These might include pre-recorded talks and required reading or online training that will be essential to fully engage with the course.

## Audience

This course is aimed at scientists working with biomage data across the life sciences. It is suitable for those involved in creating bioimages or taking their first steps in analysis. The content is also suitable for those wanting to learn more about the BioImage Archive and gain experience with machine learning approaches for image analysis. The programme will be of particular interest to bioimage analysts with questions relating to the use of ‘big data’ and using the wealth of publically available data curated in the BioImage Archive.

## Requirements

The course is accessible to members of the bioimaging community and does not require prior experience with machine learning methods or use of the BioImage Archive. Applicants are encouraged to explore the resources below before starting their application. Applicants should be comfortable with basic programming tasks and have experience working with Python.
