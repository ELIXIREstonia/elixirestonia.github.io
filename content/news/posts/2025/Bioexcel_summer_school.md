## Description

Get a feel for what the School has to offer by watching the video from last year’s edition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad9EKOVScMc.

The BioExcel School is intended primarily for PhD and post-doctoral researchers using or planning to use biomolecular modeling and simulation in their everyday research. We highly encourage applications from industrial entities, women and underrepresented groups.

BioExcel will be providing a limited number of participation fee waivers to support life science academic researchers in attending this Summer School. If you would like to be considered for the waiver, please state your interest in the registration form and check the detailed information in the “Participation fee waivers” tab. 

The summer school will include lectures and hands-on sessions on the following topics (subject to change):

* Molecular dynamics simulations
* Biomolecular docking
* Free energy calculations
* Advanced sampling methods
* BioExcel Building Blocks (BioBB)

The summer school will include lectures on the following topics (subject to change):

* Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)
* Machine learning

During the hands-on practicals you will learn how to use the BioExcel flagship software: GROMACS, HADDOCK, PMX and BioBB. The trainers, developers and experts will provide guidance and support in using the software. The School is also a great opportunity to discuss your own research and build your professional network with other participants.
