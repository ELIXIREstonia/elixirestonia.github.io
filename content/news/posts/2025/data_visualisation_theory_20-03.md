Researchers often face overwhelming raw data, making it crucial to utilize data visualization effectively. This skill transforms complex datasets into clear, insightful narratives, avoiding the pitfalls of misinterpretation through poor design. In this course, we’ll explore optimal chart types for different data, engage in interactive exercises, discuss best practices, and learn about the data-ink ratio and color selection, all illustrated with practical examples.

This course will be followed up by Tableau and Microsoft Power BI courses for beginners in April.
