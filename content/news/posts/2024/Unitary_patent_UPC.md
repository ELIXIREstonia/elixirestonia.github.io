# Hybrid seminar: Game changing development in the European patenting system: all you need to know about the Unitary Patent and the UPC

Patenting often seems out of reach for growing businesses and scientists without strong commercial support. However, the value of patenting for the development of innovation cannot be underestimated, so it is not surprising that the EPO introduced a new patenting system, including new type of patent and Patent Court that should make obtaining a patent easier and cheaper, freeing bright minds from unnecessary bureaucracy. The seminar will reveal the true impact of a simplified system on patenting strategy, as well as provide practical advice on its use.
