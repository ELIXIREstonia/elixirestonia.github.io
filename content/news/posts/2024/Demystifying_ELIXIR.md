# Webinar: Demystifying ELIXIR: Everything you ever wanted to know and more

This interactive event will help participants understand ELIXIR's structure and operations. It is particularly suitable for people who have been part of ELIXIR for less than two years, but is open to all.  Those involved in onboarding new people to Nodes might also find this webinar useful.

By the end of the session, attendees should have a clearer picture of how they fit into ELIXIR and how best to apply their knowledge and skills to maximise their impact. They should leave with answers to their questions, and understand where to find further information and how to actively engage with ELIXIR.
