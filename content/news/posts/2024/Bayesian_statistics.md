# Course at Basel, Switzerland: Introduction to Bayesian Statistics with R

This 2-day course will introduce participants to the core concepts of Bayesian statistics through lectures and practical exercises. The exercises will be implemented in the widely used R programming language and the Rstan library. They will enable participants to use standard Bayesian statistical tools and interpret their results.

Registration deadline: April 22, 2024 or as soon as the course is full
