## Description

Making research data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is an essential step during scientific publication. Raw sequencing data are often part of scientific data associated with publications and need to be FAIR. However, these data sets can be very large and challenging to annotate with metadata. There are several specialized repositories with the purpose to store and share sequence data. Each of these has its own accepted data formats, required metadata and portals. However, there is also a lot of interconnectivity between repositories. In this course, we will give an overview of these repositories and data structures in order to guide you to search and submit your sequence data in the right place. In addition, with practical exercises, you will learn how to use these portals by finding, downloading and submitting large datasets. We will mainly focus on the portals and platforms available for submitting to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), but many of the taught concepts can be applied to NCBI and DDBJ.

## Learning outcomes

At the end of this course, participants are expected to:

* Understand the main data structures underlying ENA and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)
* Find an appropriate portal for submitting and finding the most common data types related to raw NGS data
* Use the web interfaces and command line to find and download raw sequencing data from SRA
* Use the command line or FileZilla to upload files with ftp
* Successfully submit the most common data types to ENA


## Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have basic knowledge on common next generation sequencing data types (e.g. fasta, fastq, bam). Experience with the command line (either UNIX or Windows) is a plus.
Participants are required to have their own personal computer with FileZilla pre-installed.
