# Webinar by EMBL-EBI: Bioinformatic approaches to understand the role of the human microbiome in health and disease

This webinar will provide an overview of current metagenomic approaches to study the human microbiome and introduce several statistical methods that can be used to link its composition and function to different human phenotypes and populations.
This webinar is suitable for those interested in studying the microbiomes of any environment or host. Although the presentation will be focused on the human microbiome, the methods and techniques discussed will also be applicable to other microbial ecosystems. No prior knowledge of bioinformatics is required, but undergraduate level knowledge of biology would be useful.

Date & Time: Mar 6, 2024 05:30 PM
