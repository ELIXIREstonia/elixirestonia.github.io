## Description

Python is an open-source and general-purpose scripting language which runs on all major operating systems. It was designed to be easily read and written with comparatively simple syntax. Over the recent years Python has become a programming language of choice for bioinformatics and data analysis, and in particular for applications that make use of machine learning or deep learning. However, these applications usually require a good mastering of a few modules (such as numpy, or pandas) that can go beyond basic Python commands. This 1-day course will introduce modules and recipes to unlock the potential of Python for day-to-day data exploration and analysis of real-life datasets.

Topics that will be covered in this course include:

* Parsing, transforming, and exporting data using pandas
* Exploring data, and creating useful summaries using pandas and numpy
* Representing data in an efficient and impactful manner using seaborn

## Learning outcomes

At the end of this course, participants are expected to:

* Parse any tabulated data set in a couple of lines
* Summarize and perform quality control on their data
* Filter, sub-sample or aggregate specific parts of their dataset(s)
* Generate clear visual representations to explore data and communicate their findings

## Prerequisites

The course is targeted to life scientists, bioinformaticians, and researchers who are already familiar with the Python programming language and who have basic knowledge in statistics. There is a test provided on course organiser site for Python skills.
