## Description

In the course of their work, researchers encounter data in various forms. Yet, when data is presented in its raw, tabular form, it often appears as a complex puzzle. This can be incredibly overwhelming when dealing with large datasets. Fortunately, this is where the magic of data visualisation comes into play. The main idea is to extract the key insights from the data and craft a narrative around it. However, it's important to note that hasty chart-making can lead to confusion. Poorly designed visuals risk misinterpretation and can be misleading. That's why it's crucial to approach data visualisation thoughtfully and precisely.


## Learning outcomes for the participants:

* Choose appropriate chart types
* Avoid common mistakes in data visualisation
* Maximise data-ink ratio
