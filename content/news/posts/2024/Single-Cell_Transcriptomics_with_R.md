# Course at  Bern, Switzerland: Single-Cell Transcriptomics with R

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) allows researchers to study gene expression at the single cell level. For example, scRNAseq can help to identify expression patterns that differ between conditions within a cell-type. To generate and analyze scRNAseq data, several methods are available, all with their strengths and weaknesses depending on the researchersâ€™ needs. This 3-day course will cover the main technologies as well as the main aspects to consider while designing a scRNAseq experiment. In addition, it will cover the theoretical background of analysis methods with hands-on practical data analysis sessions applied to droplet-based methods.

Application deadline: 06 March 2024

## General information 
This course is intended for life scientists and bioinformaticians familiar with "Next Generation Sequencing" who want to acquire the necessary skills to analyse scRNA-seq gene expression data.

* __Time:__ 18 - 20 March 2024
* __Location:__ Bern, Switzerland
* __Fees__: The registration fees for academics are 300 CHF and 1500 CHF for for-profit companies.

## Learning objectives

At the end of the course, participants will be able to:

* distinguish advantages and pitfalls of scRNAseq
* design their own scRNA-seq experiment
* apply a downstream analysis using R

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge

* Participants should already have a basic knowledge in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques, or have already followed the "NGS - Quality control, Alignment, Visualisation".
* Knowledge in RNA sequencing is mandatory.
* Basic knowledge of R is required. 

### Technical

Attendees should have a Wi-Fi enabled computer. An online R and RStudio environment will be provided. However, in case you wish to perform the practical exercises on your own computer, please take a moment to install the following before the course:
