# Online course - NGS - Quality Control, Alignment, Visualisation

In this module, we will introduce the most used sequencing technologies and explain their concepts. Using different datasets, we will practice quality control, alignment of reads to a reference genome and visualize the output. This course is intended for life scientists who are already dealing with NGS data and would like to be able to start analysing them.

Application deadline: 01 April 2024

## General information 

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods have had a large impact on many biological fields due to a very rapid decrease in cost and throughput. It often results in hundreds of gigabytes of data. This can make the downstream analysis challenging and requires bioinformatics skills.

In this module, we will introduce the most used sequencing technologies and explain their concepts. Using different datasets, we will practice quality control, alignment of reads to a reference genome and visualize the output.

The course materials can be found in the dedicated [GitHub](https://sib-swiss.github.io/NGS-introduction-training/2023.11/) page.
