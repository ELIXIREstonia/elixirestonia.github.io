# BY-COVID project wrap-up and success stories

The BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) project aimed to provide extensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases, emphasizing the mobilization of raw viral sequences to monitor the spread of variants. To ensure global collaboration, it enabled federated data analysis, managed metadata, and facilitated long-term cataloguing. Success stories can be read [here](https://by-covid.org/pdf/update-elixir-by-covid-brochure-1-7-DIGITAL.pdf), on page 16 is project lead by University of Tartu: [Infectious Diseases Toolkit](https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/).

The project incorporated the One-Health approach and closely worked with the ISIDORe project funded through HORIZON Europe, integrating with ELIXIR, BBMRI, ECRIN, PHIRI, and CESSDA. With 53 partners from 19 countries, BY-COVID aimed to improve readiness for future pandemics, enhance genomic surveillance and rapid-response capabilities, and serve as a model of interdisciplinary collaboration, providing scientists from various sectors access to diverse data for generating new knowledge on infectious diseases.
