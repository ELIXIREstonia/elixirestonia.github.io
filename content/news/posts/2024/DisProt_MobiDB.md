# Webinar by ELIXIR-IT: DisProt and MobiDB: Exploring Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and functional information

This course is designed to facilitate the dissemination of two major resources about the disordered protein, DisProt and MobiDB, both part of ELIXIR infrastructure, within the scientific community. Through this course, participants will gain fundamental insights into Intrinsically Disordered Proteins data interpretation, the correlation with specific biological mechanisms and diseases while learning about the essential guidelines for becoming active contributors to the extensive network of DisProt curators.

Deadline for applications: 15th April 2024
