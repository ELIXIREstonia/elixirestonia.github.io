# Webinar:  DOME

DOME is a set of community-wide guidelines, recommendations and checklists, spanning these four areas (Data, Optimization, Model and Evaluation in Machine Learning) aiming to help establish standards of supervised machine learning validation in biology. The work was initially [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01205-4) in 2021 with more details on the [DOME-ML page](https://dome-ml.org/). This activity is part of the [Machine Learning Focus Group](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups/machine-learning).
