* Do you write scientific publications based on software you created yourself but do not know what unit testing, refactoring or version control are?
* Are you writing code that you find hard to understand some weeks later?
* Do you have thousands of lines of code, but no automated way of verifying that the code works correctly?
* Do you find yourself regularly using “copy & paste” to re-use code you wrote earlier?
* Do small changes in your code later cause trouble in other unexpected places?
