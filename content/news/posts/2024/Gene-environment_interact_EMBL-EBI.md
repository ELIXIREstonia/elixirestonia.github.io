# Course in EBI, UK: Gene-environment interactions in human health and disease

This introductory course is  aimed at MRes/PhD students, researchers, clinicians, and other professionals working in the fields of genomics, exposomics, epidemiology, or toxicology with an interest in understanding how interactions between genes and the environment underlie human phenotypes. The course will cover the underlying concepts, computational resources, and computational modelling methods available to investigate interactions between genes and the environment (including social, biological, and physical exposures). 

Registration deadline: 15 December 2024

Date: 17 - 21 March 2025

## Description 

This introductory course explores the complex interplay between genes and the environment in shaping human phenotypes. Participants will gain knowledge of cohort datasets, environmental readouts, and computational resources to investigate gene-environment interactions. Ethical and legal frameworks related to data privacy and consent will be discussed. The course also covers computational modelling techniques for integrating genotype and environmental effects. By the end, attendees will be equipped to analyse cohort datasets, make use of computational resources, and interpret the results. 

Please note that you will not analyse your own data as part of the course. There will, however, be ample opportunity to discuss your research and ideas with other course participants and trainers

## Prerequisites

Successful applicants will be required to have a basic understanding of statistics and Unix experience. We recommend all successful applicants acquire/brush up on their basic command line skills before attending the course. R Studio experience is also required. 

## Learning outcomes 

* Discuss the types, limitations, and advantages of human cohort datasets.
* Discuss the types, limitations, and advantages of different environmental readouts, including proxies for exposures in human cohorts.
* Explain the ethical and legal frameworks governing human data reuse and request access to datasets of interest in compliance with legal and ethical standards. 
* Use and explain the need for Federated/Trusted Research Environments.
* Employ relevant computational methods and resources to investigate gene and environment interactions and interpret the results.
* Understand how to apply techniques (GWAS, Mendelian Randomisation, predictive modelling) to analyse cohort datasets and how to interpret these results.
