# Webinar by SIB: Gene Expression made Useful Easily: Tools and Database of Bgee

This is a course on bioinformatics resources taught by the developers of the resources. Bgee is a curated database of gene expression in animals, including model species such as human, mouse or drosophila, and others such as livestock, primates, or fishes. Bgee integrates information from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq, microarrays, and in situ hybridization. These data are available through a web interface and an R package. Bgee also includes tools which use these data, such as TopAnat or Expression Comparison, and allows integration with users' own data through another R package. In this course, we will present the curated and pre-analysed gene expression data in Bgee.

Application Deadline: 17 May 2024
