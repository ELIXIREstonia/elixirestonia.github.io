* __Level:__ Beginner
* __Fees:__
  * Academic: 200 CHF
  * For-profit: 1000 CHF

## Description

This two-day course will present the theory and bioinformatics tools required to analyze RNA-seq gene expression data. The course will present the theory and bioinformatics tools required to analyse RNA-seq gene expression data, from the raw data until the biological interpretation. The following topics will be discussed:

* Quality control
* Mapping to genomes & transcriptomes
* Read counting, gene differential expression analysis
* GO enrichment and pathway analysis

## Prerequisites

* Participants should already have a basic knowledge in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques.
* Basic knowledge of the R statistical software and of the UNIX fundamentals.
* You are required to have your own Wi-Fi enabled laptop.
* You should also have access to a terminal on your computer.

## Learning outcomes

At the end of the course, the participants are expected to:

* Describe advantages and pitfalls of RNA sequencing
* Design their own experiment
* Perform the downstream analysis using command line software (QC, mapping, counting, differential expression analysis, pathway analysis, etc)
* Critically assess the quality of their results at each step of the downstream analysis
