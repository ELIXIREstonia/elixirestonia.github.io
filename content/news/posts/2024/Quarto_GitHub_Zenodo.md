## Course description

The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) principles provide guidelines for making research data and other resources more easily discoverable and reusable, which can help increase your research's impact and exposure. Adhering to these principles also ensures that your research is more reliable and reproducible, as others can more easily access and provide feedback. In addition, making your research FAIR can promote the principles of open science and make it easier for others to contribute to and build upon your work. Finally, many funding agencies and journals now expect that your research outputs be made FAIR as a condition of funding or publication, so adhering to these principles can help to ensure that your research meets these requirements.

Sharing and reusing data, software, and documentation is essential to the FAIR principles and should be a routine task for scientists. Researchers can achieve this by providing all necessary information (data, software and parameters used, scripts for the analysis, databases and their versions) and using markdown to create a single file that can be easily shared as a web page.

## Learning objectives

In this course, participants will learn tools and concepts to take significant steps towards adhering to the FAIR principles, which will enhance the benefits of sharing and collaboration in research. More specifically, at the end of the course, the participants are expected to:

* Create notebooks and websites based on Markdown, and Python or R with Quarto
* Use Git and GitHub to version control the generated content
* Host a website by making use of GitHub actions and GitHub pages
* Link the GitHub repository to Zenodo and give it a unique identiÔ¨Åer (DOI)

## Prerequisites

* Participants are expected to have an introductory level in programming with R or Python.
* Participants should have a GitHub account and bring their laptops with either the latest versions of RStudio or VSCode pre-installed.
