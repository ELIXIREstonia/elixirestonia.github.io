## General information 

* __Location:__  Online
* __Level:__ Beginner
* __Length:__ 1h
* __Fees:__ Free
* __Materials:__  https://edu.sib.swiss/course/view.php?id=624

## Description

In an era when data is being produced at unprecedented speed, using identifiers is the cornerstone which makes data findable, interoperable, and re-useable.

In this 1-h course, you will learn what is an identifier, common identifiers in bioinformatics, how to find identifiers using different tools and why their use is critical to interoperability. Examples of identifiers connected to vitamin D are presented to illustrate the range of identifiers used in bioinformatics and how these make data interoperable.

## Learning outcomes

At the end of the course, the participants are expected to:

* explain what an identifier is
* recall commonly used identifiers
* use tools to find identifiers
* explore uses of identifiers (F,I,R)
