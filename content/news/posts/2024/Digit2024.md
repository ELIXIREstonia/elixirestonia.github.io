# Uku Raudvere Delivers Talk on the Role of Research Software Engineers at Digit 2024

On October 4th, 2024, the Digit 2024 event in Tartu brought together leaders in technology and academia to celebrate the best of the software domain. Among the standout speakers was ELIXIR Estoniaâ€™s own Uku Raudvere, who delivered an insightful presentation on "The Impact of Scientific Programmers in Academia".

In his presentation, Uku highlighted the often-overlooked but essential role of research software engineers (RSEs) in modern scientific environments. As research becomes more data-intensive and experimental methods grow increasingly complex, researchers can find themselves stuck by the challenge of managing and optimising software. Uku emphasised that RSEs tackle these technical issues, enabling researchers to focus on their core scientific work. By ensuring research tools are efficient, scalable, and reliable, RSEs contribute to the success of groundbreaking discoveries.

The talk was a clear reminder of how research and technology must go hand in hand to drive scientific progress, stressing that they need to collaborate closely to advance scientific progress. We thank Uku Raudvere for highlighting the essential role of scientific programmers in academia and for sharing his knowledge with the audience at Digit 2024.
