## Description

In this interactive online workshop we will introduce the FAIR principles in the context of bioimaging data. Designed for researchers across all scales of bioimaging, from molecules to humans, this workshop will provide simple yet effective steps for a smooth start to your FAIR journey. We will explore the benefits of FAIR data for molecular, cellular as well as pre-clinical imaging and best practices for data management. Featuring invited speakers from bioimaging repositories, we will discuss what you can do with your data after publication. And if you want to take it one step further, there will also be advanced sessions on cloud compatible next-generation file formats for image data. By the end of the workshop, you will no longer find FAIR to be an intimidating concept that you have been putting off. Instead, you will be equipped with the knowledge and resources to identify and implement the necessary adjustments to bring your bioimaging data to the next level.
