#  Virtual 2 Day Workshop SABIO-RK and FAIRDOMHub / FAIRDOM-SEEK

[SABIO-RK](https://sabiork.h-its.org/) is a manually curated database for biochemical reactions and their kinetic properties. [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/) is a free research data management platform built upon the [FAIRDOM-SEEK software](http://fairdomseek.org).  FAIRDOM-SEEK contains specific features for systems biologists for data and model management. This is an introductory course for SABIO-RK and FAIRDOMHub. You have the option to participate in either one or both of the courses.

SABIO-RK: 25-NOV-2024 2:00 pm - 5:00pm (CET / UTC +1)

FAIRDOM-SEEK: 26-NOV-2024 2:00 pm - 6:00pm (CET / UTC +1)

## Description

__[SABIO-RK](https://sabiork.h-its.org/)__ is a manually curated database for biochemical reactions and their kinetic properties. Data are mainly extracted from literature and include detailed information about biochemical reactions, their kinetic rate equations with parameters and experimental conditions.

Agenda:

* Introduction to SABIO-RK
* Hands-on session: manual search and export functionalities
* Hands-on session: programmatic access

__[FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/)__ is a free research data management platform built upon the __[FAIRDOM-SEEK software](http://fairdomseek.org)__. FAIRDOM-SEEK is an open source tool for uploading, organizing, sharing and publishing scientific research data. FAIRDOM-SEEK contains specific features for systems biologists for data and model management.

Agenda: 

* Introduction to FAIRDOMHub / FAIRDOM-SEEK
* Demo of programmatic access
* Hands-on session:
* Storage and exchange of data and models according to the FAIR principles
* Modeling specific functionalities in FAIRDOMHub / FAIRDOM-SEEK


## Learning outcomes

Comprehensive understanding of SABIO-RK, FAIRDOMHub / FAIRDOM-SEEK

## Prerequisites

For the SABIO-RK hands-on session you will need Python and the [Python library Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).
