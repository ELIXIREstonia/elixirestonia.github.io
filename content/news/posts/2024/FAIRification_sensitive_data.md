## Course description

Sensitive data is ‘information that is regulated by law due to possible risk for plants, animals, individuals and/or communities and for public and private organisations’ (David et al, 2020). It is with these kinds of data in mind that the phrase “as open as possible and as closed as necessary” is now presented as part of the ‘Accessible’ principle of FAIR. There are many different types of sensitive data, and they exist in relation to many different contexts and disciplinary approaches. Perhaps most familiar to many will be personal data – for example names collected during a survey or interview –  but there is also commercially sensitive information, data relating to the military or national security, and data about vulnerable species, and more.
