## Description

BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID) project collects comprehensive open data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases across scientific, medical, public health and policy domains.

Into the Infectious Disease Toolkit (IDTk), we gather knowledge we wish we had when the pandemic hit us in the spring of 2020.

At the contentathon participants will contribute to writing guidelines for data handling, analysis and visualisations in the context of infectious diseases. We gather knowledge into the following subsections of IDTkit - attributing credit, data analysis, data communication, data description, data sources, ethical legal and social issues, provenance, and quality control. Additionally, applied examples are part of the showcases and country-specific examples form national resources.

## Goals

* Provide content to the pages that are still missing information.
* Write up more use cases; finish up the pages as much as possible.
* Prepare the paper about IDTkit.
