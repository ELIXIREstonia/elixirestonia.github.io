R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on various UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

RStudio is an essential tool for anyone involved in R programming. It plays a vital role in data analysis by facilitating data import, access, transformation, exploration, visualization, and modeling tasks. If you're embarking on your journey to learn R, now is the perfect moment to familiarize yourself with RStudio. Discover what RStudio is, how to install it, and begin harnessing its capabilities to enhance your data analysis and programming skills.

It would be beneficial to participate in [OpenRefine course](https://elixir.ut.ee/news/2024/08/22/OpenRefine_data_cleaning/), so your data would be clean before you start analysing it.
