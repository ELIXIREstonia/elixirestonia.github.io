# Course at EMBL-EBI: Summer school in bioinformatics

European Bioinformatics Institute United Kingdom in association with Elixir Estonia are organising summer school in bioinformatics. This course provides an introduction to the use of bioinformatics in biological research, giving you guidance for using bioinformatics in your work whilst also providing hands-on training in tools and resources appropriate to your research.

Applicants are expected to be at an early stage of using bioinformatics in their research with the need to develop their knowledge and skills further. No previous knowledge of programming is required for this course.

Applications close: 25 February 2024

You will initially be introduced to bioinformatics theory and practice, including best practices for undertaking bioinformatics analysis, data management, and reproducibility. 

You will be required to review some pre-recorded material for their group project prior to the start of the course.

* __Time:__ 17 - 21 June 2024
* __Location:__ 	European Bioinformatics Institute, United Kingdom
* __Price:__ 	£850.00 inclusive of four nights accommodation and catering, including dinner
* __Places:__ 30


A major element of this course is a group project, where you'll be placed in small groups to work together on a challenge set by trainers from EMBL-EBI and external institutes. This allows you to explore the bioinformatics tools and resources available in your area of interest and apply them to a set problem, providing you with hands-on experience relevant to your own research. The group work will culminate in a presentation session involving everyone on the final day of the course, giving an opportunity for wider discussion on the benefits and challenges of working with biological data.

Groups are mentored and supported by the trainers who set the initial challenge, but the groups will be responsible for driving their projects forward, with all members expected to take an active role. Groups are pre-organised before the course, and all group members will be sent some short “homework” in preparation for your project work prior to the start of the course.

Group projects:

* Genome variation across human populations 
* Interpreting functional information from large scale protein structure data
* Modelling cell signalling pathways
* Improving AI-based bioimage analysis 
* Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis with Python
* Networks and pathways

Learning outcomes for the participants:

* Discuss applications of bioinformatics in biological research
* Browse, search, and retrieve biological data from public repositories
* Use appropriate bioinformatics tools to explore biological data
* Describe ways that biological data can be stored, organised, and integrated
