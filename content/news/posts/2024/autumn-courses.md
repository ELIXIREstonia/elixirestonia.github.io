Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is an interpreted language, which makes it suitable for rapid development and prototyping of programming segments or complete small programs.

Pythonâ€™s main advantages:

* Open source software, supported by Python Software Foundation
* Available on all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* It is a good language for new programmers to learn due to its straightforward, object-oriented style.
* It is well-structured, which aids readability.
* It is extensible (i.e. modifiable) and is supported by a large community that provides a comprehensive range of 3rd party packages.

Learning outcomes for the participants:

* Understand Python variables, basic data types, and operators.
* Learn to control the flow of programs using loops, conditionals, and functions in Python.
* Learn about and manipulate Python's built-in data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
* Understand how to read, write, and manipulate files in Python, handle exceptions, and learn the principles of object-oriented programming.
