## Description

Are you struggling to answer a question about proteins, more specifically, enzymes? Unsure whether the information you need is in UniProt? If so, this webinar is for you.

UniProt is the worldâ€™s leading high-quality, comprehensive and freely accessible resource of protein sequence and functional information. Enhanced enzyme annotation in UniProtKB is based on Rhea, a comprehensive expert-curated database of biochemical reactions that uses the ChEBI ontology to describe reaction participants.

Starting with a biological question (I.e., Could you refine my list of enzymes to identify the ones with cysteine at the active and/or allosteric sites?), you will explore the different ways of answering it, using UniProt's advanced query, or SPARQL when the use of UniProt advanced queries is not applicable. Hints on how to extend queries to other biological contexts will also be provided.


## Learning outcomes

At the end of the course, the participants are expected to:

* describe the information on enzymes found in UniProt
* use the advanced search to query UniProt for enzyme information
* recognize when the advanced search cannot be used to answer a question
* understand how a SPARQL query is constructed
* execute a SPARQL query to retrieve enzyme data from UniProt
* know where to find help, documentation and get support
