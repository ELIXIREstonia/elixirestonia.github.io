## General information 

* __Time:__ 27 June 2024  12:00-13:30 BST/ 14:00 EET 
* __Location:__ Online
* __Fees:__ Free

## Course description

Improve your knowledge of standards, repositories, and policies to help your decision-making and other activities related to the FAIR management of all digital research objects. This course is suitable for all disciplines.

Across all disciplines, there are thousands of repositories (databases and knowledge bases), as well as community-developed standards for (the identification, citation and reporting of) digital objects such as datasets, software and materials. Making the right choice is challenging, but understanding this evolving landscape is essential: standards and repositories are pillars of the FAIR Principles.

This workshop introduces FAIRsharing, a widely-adopted, curated, informative and educational resource on standards inter-related to repositories and policies across all disciplines. FAIRsharing guides consumers in discovering and selecting these resources confidently, producers in making their resources more discoverable and widely adopted, and powers third-party tools by providing trustworthy content to promote standards and databases.

## Learning objectives

As a result of attending this workshop, you will grow your knowledge of how FAIRsharing can drive your decisions and activities, specifically by:

* Learning functionality and content
* How to discover appropriate standards (reporting guidelines, terminologies, formats and models) to describe and report data in the Life Sciences or according to your requirements
* How to choose a repository (databases and knowledge bases) according to a variety of criteria and data access/deposition needs
* How to register your institutional repositories and/or policies
* How to create a FAIRsharing Collection and/or an Organization page to showcase repositories, standards and policy relevant to your discipline(s) or institution
* How the Advanced Search and FAIRsharing Assistant wizard helps with finding and selecting resources
* Examples of third party tools utilising FAIRsharing content for FAIR evaluation/assessment, DMP creation, KG development and more
* Where to find documentation to access FAIRsharing content via its API to power relevant tools or services
* How to enhance your guidance and training material for researchers by endorsing and signposting FAIRsharing content and educational material
* How to critically evaluate Life Science standards and repositories, to help researchers with FAIR management of digital objects, by providing a global view of their coverage, life cycle status and relationships
* How to meet the policy requirements, around standards and repositories, by funders, journal publishers, institutions and other organisations
* How to join the FAIRsharing Community Champion Programme for contributing to curation activities, expanding educational provision and gaining recognition, professional development and influence
* About community activity around FAIR evaluation/assessment, including caveats/warnings and future directions

## Prerequisites

* Familiarity with FAIR Principles is advised.
