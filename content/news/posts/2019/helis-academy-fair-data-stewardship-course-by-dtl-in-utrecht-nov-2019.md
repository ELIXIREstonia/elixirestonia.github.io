# Helis Academy - FAIR Data Stewardship course by DTL in Utrecht Nov 2019

<p>From 4-6th November, 2019, we will give another round of the Helis Academy - FAIR Data Stewardship course:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>FAIR Data Stewardship – digital data scholarship for life scientists</strong></p>

<p>The target audience is life scientists – from industry and academia – and graduate students in the Life Sciences who wish to improve their digital scholarship on data handling. Some basic experience with programming and scripting languages like python, perl, R, matlab, etc. are an advantage, but not needed.&nbsp;The course is also relevant for Data Stewards who are supporting the life science researchers.</p>

<p>The course will introduce the trainees to important concepts of data stewardship. We start with a general introduction covering the data life cycle, the FAIR principles and a definition of data stewardship and data stewards.</p>

<p>The course will introduce the trainees to important concepts of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/research-data-management/research-data-management/">data stewardship</a>.&nbsp;We start with a general introduction covering the data life cycle, the&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fsdata.2016.18">FAIR principles</a>&nbsp;and a definition of data stewardship and data stewards.</p>

<p>We will pass the stages of the data life cycle in more detail in the training modules of this 3 day course.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Day 1: Why use a data management plan and what for?</strong>&nbsp;On day one trainees will investigate data management plans, which types are there and how they should be used.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Day 2: Mastering the data chaos during the research phase.</strong>&nbsp;On day two the course highlights how to work with data during the research phase, explaining how to create well formatted data which helps in the second module of day two to make data interoperable already during the active research phase.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Day 3: Boost your visibility and get cited for your data!</strong>&nbsp;On day three trainees will have an in-depth at persistent identifiers, different use cases and types of identifiers. Finally we are closing the data life cycle by making data fit for sharing, archiving and publishing. The training is organised by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dtls.nl/">DTL</a>and delivered as a joint effort by DTL partners.</li>
</ul>
