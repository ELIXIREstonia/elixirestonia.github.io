# Weekly news 02.04.2019

<p>Please note that registration is now open for the&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIXIR EXCELERATE&nbsp;course "Single cell RNA-seq data analysis with R" which takes place 27.-29.5.2019 at CSC in Espoo (Helsinki), Finland. This hands-on course covers several aspects of single cell RNA-seq data analysis, ranging from clustering and differential gene expression analysis to trajectories, cell type identification and spatial transcriptomics. The course is organized by ELIXIR Finland in collaboration with ELIXIR Sweden, Norway, Germany, Netherlands and France, and it is free of charge.</p>

<p>The application deadline for the course is 16.4.2019. Participants are selected based on their motivation description, and we will also do our best to ensure that every country / research group gets at least one representative in the course. For registration and more information, please see the course website at&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/scrnaseq" href="https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/scrnaseq">https://www.csc.fi/web/training/-/scrnaseq</a>.<br />

BioContainers presents two new features: (1)&nbsp;<a href="https://elixir-europe.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=751beffce2e491f94d6f66918&amp;id=2e8b69c74b&amp;e=64fa86a9a6">users can trace the usage of every container on the&nbsp;registry page</a>. (2) a similarity component &nbsp;between all containers taking into account the metadata. At the end for each container, there is a set of suggestions for similar containers.&nbsp;<a href="https://elixir-europe.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=751beffce2e491f94d6f66918&amp;id=54db719b0b&amp;e=64fa86a9a6">See blast</a></p>

<p>Registration is open for the BioExcel Summer School on Biomolecular Simulations, taking place in Pula, Italy on 30 June - 5 July 2019. The summer school includes lectures and hands-on sessions on Molecular Dynamics simulations, Biomolecular Docking, QM/MM, Free energy calculations and advanced sampling methods (Metadynamics).<br />
Registration to the PRACE/BioExcel Seasonal School HPC for Life Sciences is now open. The programme will allow participants to get a comprehensive understanding of the usage of the different codes; their scalability and performance, as well as ways to avoid potential issues; and learn the best practices about using them on HPC systems.</p>

<p>The next CORBEL webinar titled “A Basic Introduction to Bioimage Analysis” featuring Christian Tischer from the EMBL Centre for Bioimage Analysis (CBA), will take place on 11 April 2019 at 15:30 CEST.</p>
