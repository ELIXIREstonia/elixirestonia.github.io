	<li>Introduction to High-Throughput Sequencing and Quality Control</li>
	<li>Reference-based RNA-seq data analysis</li>
	<li>Basics of R programming</li>
	<li>Post-processing of RNA-seq data using R and Rstudio</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="important-notes">Important notes</h1>

<p>The workshop is free of charge and covers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>3 days of training</li>

<p>No stipends for travel or accommodation are available.</p>

<p>Desktop computers will be available. You can also bring your&nbsp;<em>own notebook</em>&nbsp;if you prefer . Eduroam is available, ask your institute how to connect.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>social dinner</strong>&nbsp;will be organised at each site on Tuesday October 8th. This dinner will be at your own cost, but we would love to have a chat with you after the workshop!</p>

<h1 id="workshop-format">Workshop Format</h1>

<p>This will be a&nbsp;<strong>hybrid training</strong>. This means the instructors will teach in front of a camera, and this video feed is live-streamed to multiple locations around the world. Each location will have several other instructors and helpers on site to answer questions and who can take over teaching in case this is needed.</p>

<p>We will use&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/gallantries-chat">this collaborative document</a>&nbsp;for asking and answering questions during the workshop. This document also contains links to all other materials you will need during the course.</p>

<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>

<p>The workshop will use the&nbsp;<a href="https://usegalaxy.eu/">European Galaxy server</a>&nbsp;to perform all data analysis. Please register there ahead of time to streamline the training.</p>

<p>You must go through two Galaxy interactive tours before beginning the training. These interactive tours guide you stepwise through the Galaxy user interface and the history. They will help you to follow the Galaxy introduction, and ensure everyone has a basic understanding of how Galaxy works.</p>
