# Biocuration survey

<p>On behalf of our ELIXIR colleagues, please find time to contribute to a biocuration survey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear colleagues,</p>

<p>we would need your help to disseminate a survey among all scientists you may know. Please forward it as much as possible.</p>

<p>This survey is part of an ELIXIR Implementation Study designed to map the landscape of biocuration, the resources and tools used, and the training that is available and required.</p>

<p>It is addressed to scientists who may have a role in the management, storage, transformation and annotation of data and that in order to help answer biological questions. Your answers would help us understand who does this work, which tools and resources are used, or what are the training needs.</p>

<p>You can launch the survey by following this link: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/Biocuration-ELIXIR">https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/Biocuration-ELIXIR</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We greatly value your contribution and look forward to sharing the outcomes with you.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Sarah, Alex, Melissa (ELIXIR-EMBL-EBI), &nbsp;Pete (FAIRsharing/ELIXIR-UK), and Patricia (SIB/ELIXIR-CH).</p>

<p>On behalf of the Elixir Implementation Study - Mapping the landscape of Biocuration in ELIXIR: Practice, capability and training requirements&nbsp;</p>
