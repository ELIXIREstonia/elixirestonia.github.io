<h2><em>From accelerating to converging</em></h2>

<p>After the completion of the successful&nbsp;<a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/excelerate">ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project</a>, which provided&nbsp; ELIXIR with solid foundations, today ELIXIR kicks off a new project to support the provision of data management across Europe.</p>

<p><a href="https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge">ELIXIR-CONVERGE</a>, a €5 million three-year H2020 project, will bring together experts from all 23 ELIXIR Nodes, representing 29 research institutes and 22 countries across Europe to work collaboratively on some of the major challenges in data access, provisioning and distribution. The development of a data management toolkit will sit at the core of the project, providing researchers with a strategy to manage their data to international standards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The toolkit will be tested across multiple domains and data types against ‘Demonstrator Projects’ that cover:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plant genotype and phenotype</li>
	<li>Epitranscriptomics</li>
	<li>Marine metagenomics</li>
	<li>Human genomics</li>
	<li>Toxicology</li>
	<li>Bimolecular simulation</li>
</ul>

<p>Niklas Blomberg, Director of ELIXIR and Coordinator of ELIXIR-CONVERGE,&nbsp;said: “Many ELIXIR Nodes already provide local support and expertise with data management to national research projects and life scientists in that country. With the ELIXIR-CONVERGE project, we want to ensure that this data management provision is as developed as possible within each country and as connected as it can be across countries too. While data generation is a local process, often the expertise for the management of that dataset sits in another country, or the resource where the data will be deposited is in a different country. So there is a strong need to move beyond national data management support, we need to connect them across countries. ELIXIR-CONVERGE will allow us to construct that system across Europe”.</p>
