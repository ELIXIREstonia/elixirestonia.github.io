# EMBO practical course in population genomics in Italy

<p><font face="verdana, sans-serif">ELIXIR-IIB is pleased to announce the fourth edition of the EMBO practical course in population genomics,&nbsp;this year there will be added emphasis on programming and machine learning applied to population genomics.</font></p>

<p><a href="https://elixir-iib-training.github.io/website/2020/04/01/population-genomics-procida.html" target="_blank">https://elixir-iib-training.github.io/website/2020/04/01/population-genomics-procida.html</a></p>

<p><font face="verdana, sans-serif"><b>Registration deadline is 28 January 2020</b></font></p>

<p><font face="verdana, sans-serif">This EMBO Practical Course will cover coalescent theory, the effect of demography in space and time, genetic clustering, the detection and quantification of admixture and selection. Lectures on these topics will be complemented by hands-on computer practicals introducing a wide range of software packages, both in R and Python.<br />
<br />
This course is aimed at evolutionary biologists who already have basic bioinformatics skills. The main criterion for selection will be how much a candidate can benefit from the course. This implies that PhD students and Postdoc researchers will likely be favoured; however, applications from candidates at all levels will be considered.</font></p>

<p><b>Fellowships to cover travel expenses and for childcare are available.</b></p>
