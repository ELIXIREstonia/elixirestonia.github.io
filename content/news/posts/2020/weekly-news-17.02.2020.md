<p>19 February 2020 | Online | 14:00 GMT/15:00 CET</p>

<p>Most of what we know about human diseases and genes/proteins involved in them is buried in the biomedical literature. Text mining is thus a key tool for creating databases with structured data on disease-gene associations and the underlying gene networks.</p>

<p>In this webinar, Lars Juhl Jensen from the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, will describe a highly efficiently text-mining pipeline, which allows his team to systematically mine such information from very large corpora of full-text articles as well as abstracts. The presentation will also cover how this information is made available through interoperable, web-based databases, including the DISEASES database and the STRING database (an ELIXIR Core Data Resource). Finally, Lars will show how the Cytoscape stringApp brings together these databases, allowing users to easily retrieve, analyze, and visualize gene networks for diseases or other topics of interest.</p>

<p>Lars Juhl Jensen is a professor at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. His research group develops state-of-the-art tools for generation and analysis of molecular interaction networks from proteomics data and text mining. The tools are freely available to the scientific community.</p>
