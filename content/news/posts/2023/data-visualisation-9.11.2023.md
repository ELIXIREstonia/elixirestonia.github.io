<p>In the course of their work, researchers encounter data in various forms. Yet, when data is presented in its raw, tabular form, it often appears as a complex puzzle. This can be especially overwhelming when dealing with large datasets. Fortunately, this is where the magic of data visualization comes into play. The main idea is to extract the key insights from the data and craft a narrative around it. However, it's important to note that hasty chart-making can lead to confusion. Poorly designed visuals not only risk misinterpretation but can also be misleading. That's why it's crucial to approach data visualization thoughtfully and precisely.</p>

<p>This webinar will discuss why data visualisation is important and what we should consider when designing it. This means what chart type to pick, how much information to include, what (and how) to highlight, and so on. The webinar will have a theoretical aspect, and we will assess examples from real life.</p>

<p>This lecture will be followed up by a separate workshop on the 14th of November called <a href="https://elixir.ut.ee/node/552">“RStudio Visualisation</a>,” where you can put your knowledge into practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Learning outcomes for the participants:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose appropriate chart types</li>
	<li>Avoid common mistakes in data visualisation</li>
	<li>Maximise data-ink ratio</li>
</ul>
