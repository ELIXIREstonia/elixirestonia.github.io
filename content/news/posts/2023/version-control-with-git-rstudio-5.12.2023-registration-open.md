<p>Version control serves as the digital equivalent of a lab notebook. It is employed by professionals to monitor their progress and collaborate effectively. Its utility extends beyond software development; it can be used for books, papers, small datasets, or any evolving content that requires sharing.</p>

<p>Git is a globally adopted tool that helps developers manage changes in collaborative projects. Keeping a record of changes, complete with timestamps and explanations, becomes exceptionally valuable when returning to a project in the future, like a year later when recollection may be unclear.<br />
