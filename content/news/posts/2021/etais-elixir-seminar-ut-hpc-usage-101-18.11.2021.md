# ETAIS & ELIXIR seminar  UT HPC Usage 101 18.11.2021 

<p>During this UT HPC Usage&nbsp;101 lecture course we will provide the participants&nbsp;basic knowledge required to use to submit, monitor, and control jobs on the compute&nbsp;nodes&nbsp;of UT HPC. We will talk about the principles of computing in a cluster and the difference between computing directly from the command line of a private server. We will introduce the good practices and standards of behavior that&nbsp;good cluster usage practice requires. Also the&nbsp;convenient graphical tools for monitoring the resource of your work will be covered. Finally, we might touch on the basic Slurm commands.</p>

<p>We expect the users to have basic LINUX command line experience, but very little or no cluster compute experience yet.<br />
<br />
Learning outcome:<br />
Knowing how to&nbsp;submit, monitor and control jobs at UT HPC.</p>

<p>The seminar will take place in Zoom on 18th of November 2021 at 14.00 and will last approximately 90 minutes. The seminar will not be recorded.</p>

<p>Registration is open at&nbsp;https://forms.gle/pVe86HVqjWB6GpLg8 and will close on 16th of November or when the course gets full.&nbsp;</p>
