# “How FAIR are you” Webinar Series and Hackathon (Jan-Apr 2021) organised by CINECA

<p>The <strong>“How FAIR are you” </strong>webinar series and hackathon aim at increasing and facilitating the uptake of FAIR approaches into software, training materials and cohort data, to facilitate responsible and ethical data and resource sharing and implementation of federated applications for data analysis.</p>

<p>The hackathon will be a practical online event to investigate gaps in the application of FAIR principles to project outputs and facilitate the implementation of FAIR approaches, where possible. The Hackathon will focus on cohort data, software tools including workflows, algorithms as well as web services, and training materials. The hackathon will be preceded by a “How FAIR are you” webinar series to provide background and introduce theoretical concepts that might be useful during the practical sessions. All participants are encouraged to attend or watch the recordings of the webinar series.&nbsp;</p>
