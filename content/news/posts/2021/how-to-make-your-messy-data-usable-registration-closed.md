# How to make your messy data usable? (registration closed)

<p dir="ltr">On the<b> </b>25th of November 2021, ELIXIR-Estonia will be holding a new data management online course: How to make your messy data usable. The course will be held in English. This course will be in two parts: an 1 hour online lecture on what makes a data table usable for other people held on 25th of November at 13:00 in Zoom. The practical workshop on cleaning your messy data with OpenRefine software will be a video lecture that you can follow in your own time. Additionally, we will hold 3 Q&amp;A sessions in Zoom, where you can talk about any problems you encountered with the OpenRefine software.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More attention is put on what researchers do with the data (and other resources) they produce in recent years, especially in Europe, also in everywhere else. Since most of your data needs to be uploaded to a repository, it is essential that the data is tidy and other people understand and can easily read your data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this course, we will be going over how to name your files and variables, version control, compile a data dictionary, and what to do with empty cells. In the second part, OpenRefine software is introduced. With this, you can easily clean up the messy data. For the more practical aspect of using the OpenRefine software, I will share a video that will teach the basics. You can watch it anytime and do the lessons yourself. On three days (29.11, 30.11 and 1.12) there will be a 1h slot (11:00-12:00) on Zoom, when you can come and ask any question you have regarding tables and OpenRefine software.&nbsp;</p>
