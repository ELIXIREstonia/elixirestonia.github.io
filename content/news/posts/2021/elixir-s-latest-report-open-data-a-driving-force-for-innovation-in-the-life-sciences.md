# ELIXIR’s latest report: "Open data: A driving force for innovation in the life sciences"

<p>Open access life science resources such as data and software, are fundamental for breakthrough discoveries, scientific excellence and entrepreneurial endeavours. Seventy-six percent of companies surveyed in our newest report “Open data: a driving force for innovation in the life sciences” state that their product or service would not exist without data on open repositories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the importance of these freely available resources is widely accepted, there are sparse efforts to quantify the benefit, despite the need to demonstrate value to funders and policymakers. This report is an up-to-date quantification on the benefit of open data to industry and innovation, with an extensive survey, testimonials, and analysis of the hotspots of European innovation.&nbsp;</p>
