# CINECA FAIR events - ELSI seminar and hackathon, April 2021

<p><strong><u>Ethics/ELSI considerations - From FAIR to fair data sharing&nbsp;on April 15th, ONLINE</u></strong></p>

<p>The CINECA "How FAIR are you" webinar series last&nbsp;webinar&nbsp;by Dr Melanie Goisauf, from BBMRI-ERIC<br />
<br />
The FAIR principles – standing for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability – have become the guiding principles for the wider sharing of research data in the life sciences. While FAIR provides guidance for the management of data as well as tools and workflows, the institutional conditions and organizational challenges associated with data sharing need to be taken into account to ensure responsible and fair data practices. This requires considering the context of legal requirements, for instance the principle of fairness and transparency in GDPR, expectations of research participants/data subjects, societal aspects and the “ethics work” that is an integral part of data flows, as well as fairness, equity and benefit sharing within transnational collaborations, which is of utmost importance. This webinar will, from the perspective of ethical, legal and societal implications (ELSI), discuss this broader context of responsible and fair data sharing associated with FAIR.</p>

<p><u><strong>“How FAIR are you” Hackathon on April 28-29, ONLINE</strong></u></p>

<p>The hackathon will be a practical online event to investigate gaps in the application of FAIR principles to project outputs and facilitate the implementation of FAIR approaches, where possible. The Hackathon will focus on cohort data, software tools including workflows, algorithms as well as web services, and training materials</p>

<p>This hackathon will be an online event and will run over 2 days for 4 hours each day. The participants will be grouped into 3 streams: cohort metadata, software tools and training materials. Each stream will discuss current practices and recommendations for moving towards a practical application of FAIR principles and will explore the FAIRness of participants’ resources using assessment tools. Additional CINECA staff will be on hand for questions.</p>
