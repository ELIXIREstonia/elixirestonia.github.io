# Research funding information day ‘Funding Nudge 2026’

On 12 February from 10:00 to 16:00, the Grant Office invites researchers and project managers to the research funding information day “Funding Nudge 2026”, which will take place at the university library.

<!-- more -->

The aim of the event is to support researchers in navigating funding opportunities, preparing successful applications, and ensuring the smooth implementation of research projects.


This year’s information day focuses on researchers’ (general) competencies and division of roles:

* What skills are needed for successful funding applications and project implementation
* What tasks the researcher undertakes themselves
* Why a project manager is needed
* How support specialists can assist

The event will be held in Estonian, with live English neural translation available on site.
